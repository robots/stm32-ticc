#STM32 based TICC


This project is based on TAPR's TICC project.


## Hardware

The frontend for time capture is copied from their schematic. Change has been done to input PICDIV that is responsible for coarse clock generation.

Original design uses pic12f675. For this design I have used pic12f1572. The software differences are only minor - few bank switch instructions. Hardware differense is almost none. Functional
difference is yet to be determined. But I dont think that the deterministic behavior of PIC has been changed.

Workhorse has been changed from ATMEGA to something more recent. I have used STM32F042.

This MCU has integrated 48MHz oscillator with clock recovery from USB, USB peripheral, lots of flash/ram for such simple project.


## Software

TICC presents on USB as ACM device. This works without any additional driver on linux. For windows i dont know - you will probably need ST's ACM driver. (google is your friend)

To connect use any terminal emulator you like - windows: realterm, teraterm, hyperterminal, ... for linux: minicom, screen, tio. Set speed to something reasonable (eg. 921600) and hit enter.

You should be presented with command line prompt ">".

Commands are:

help - prints help
reboot - reboots board
dfu - switches mcu to dfu mode. Carefull, you will need dfu-util to bring device back to live.
cfg - configuration submenu

cfg show - prints current configuration
cfg set xx blabla - sets variable "xx" to value "blabla"
cfg save - saves configuration to eeprom (not working yet)

Most configuration options are same as TICC, for more info refer to their documentation.

# Building
You will need gnuarm toolchain, gnu make and dfu-util.

Make sure that you have arm toolchain in PATH, enter "main" directory, and type "make bin".

To write the firmware to board use "dfu.sh" script. This script does two things: writes firmware and writes options to exit dfu mode.

# Credits
Software has been mostly written from scratch except for:
- usb stack, stdlibrary - from ST
- time interval calculation routines and TDC7200 driver  - from original TICC project, mostly rewritten or adapted for better readability - https://github.com/TAPR/TICC
